# Overview

This program allows a message from a user to be encrypted or decrypted based on their provided passphrase. The user can choose to send a message, which will be encrypted for them using an encryption key produced from their passphrase, or they can decrypt a received message from the correct passphrase.

The purpose of this software is have password-based encryption and decryption ready to be implemented into an actual messenger app. My other intent was to become familiar with the Kotlin language as well as encryption.

Through this process I learned about encryption and password-based encryption. I learned the Kotlin language, particularly how to work with arrays in Kotlin, how to take and use user input, and how to implement functions and classes.
{Link to be provided soon.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* I would like to implement encryption libraries in the future for a more secure encryption process.
* I would like to change the format to mobile app for a better user interface.
* Ultimately I would like to add this software to a messenger app to encrypt messages sent from user to user.
